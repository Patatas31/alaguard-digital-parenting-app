# AlaGuard Project - Explained Like You're 5 Years Old 🧒

## 📱 What is AlaGuard?
Think of AlaGuard like a **digital babysitter** that helps parents watch what their kids do on their phones/tablets. It's like having eyes in the back of your head, but for technology!

## 🎨 About the Figma Design

### ❌ **Current Status: NO Figma Design Followed**
- The project I created uses **generic Flutter design**
- It has basic colors (blue, white, gray) and simple layouts
- It's functional but NOT based on your specific Figma mockups

### ✅ **What We Need to Do:**
1. **Get your Figma design file** (the link or export)
2. **Recreate the exact screens** from your mockups
3. **Match colors, fonts, and layouts** exactly
4. **Copy the user interface** pixel by pixel

### 🔧 **How to Add Figma Design:**
```dart
// Instead of generic colors like this:
static const Color primaryColor = Color(0xFF2196F3); // Generic blue

// We'll use YOUR exact colors like:
static const Color primaryColor = Color(0xFF1A73E8); // Your specific blue
static const Color accentColor = Color(0xFFFF6B35);   // Your specific orange
```

## 🤖 Android Focus (But Also iOS Compatible)

### 📱 **Android First Approach:**
```yaml
# In pubspec.yaml - Android gets priority
flutter:
  # Android-specific settings
  android:
    minSdkVersion: 21  # Android 5.0+
    targetSdkVersion: 34  # Latest Android
    
  # iOS still works but secondary
  ios:
    minimumOSVersion: 11.0
```

### 🔧 **Android-Specific Features We Can Add:**
1. **Device Admin Rights** (Android only)
2. **App Usage Stats** (Android has better APIs)
3. **System-level monitoring** (Deeper Android integration)
4. **Custom launchers** (Android specialty)

## 🚀 Launcher Functionality - THE BIG QUESTION!

### 🤔 **Your Question: "Will AlaGuard auto-run when child opens phone?"**

### ✅ **YES, but with conditions:**

#### **Option 1: Background Service (Easier)**
```dart
// This runs in background always
class BackgroundMonitoringService extends StatefulWidget {
  // Monitors app usage even when AlaGuard is closed
  // Sends data to parents automatically
  // Works like WhatsApp - always watching
}
```

#### **Option 2: Custom Launcher (Advanced)**
```dart
// This REPLACES the phone's home screen
class AlaGuardLauncher extends StatefulWidget {
  // Child sees AlaGuard instead of normal home screen
  // Parents control what apps child can see
  // Like parental control mode on TV
}
```

#### **Option 3: Device Administrator (Most Powerful)**
```xml
<!-- In Android manifest -->
<receiver android:name=".DeviceAdminReceiver">
  <!-- This gives AlaGuard special powers -->
  <!-- Can prevent uninstalling -->
  <!-- Can monitor everything -->
</receiver>
```

## 🧠 How The Code Works - SUPER SIMPLE EXPLANATION

### 1. **The App Structure (Like a House)**
```
alaguard_app/
├── lib/                    # The main house
│   ├── main.dart          # Front door (app starts here)
│   ├── app.dart           # Living room (main setup)
│   ├── features/          # Different rooms
│   │   ├── authentication/  # Security room (login)
│   │   ├── dashboard/      # Control room (parent sees everything)
│   │   ├── monitoring/     # Spy room (watches child)
│   │   └── notifications/  # Alert room (sends warnings)
```

### 2. **How Data Flows (Like Water in Pipes)**
```dart
Child uses phone → 
  Monitoring service watches → 
    Sends data to Firebase → 
      Parent gets notification → 
        Parent sees dashboard
```

### 3. **The Main Files Explained:**

#### **main.dart - The Starting Point**
```dart
void main() async {
  // This is like turning on the house electricity
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  // Connect to Firebase (like connecting to internet)
  await Firebase.initializeApp();
  
  // Start the app (like opening the front door)
  runApp(const AlaGuardApp());
}
```

#### **Authentication (Login System)**
```dart
// Like a bouncer at a club
class AuthProvider {
  // Checks if parent is allowed in
  Future<bool> signIn(String email, String password) {
    // "Are you really the parent?"
    // "Show me your ID (email/password)"
  }
}
```

#### **Dashboard (Parent's Control Panel)**
```dart
// Like a security guard's monitor room
class ParentDashboard {
  // Shows all children
  // Shows their activities
  // Shows warnings
  // Like CCTV for phones
}
```

#### **Monitoring (The Spy System)**
```dart
// Like a hidden camera
class MonitoringProvider {
  // Watches what child does
  // Records app usage
  // Tracks websites visited
  // Sends reports to parent
}
```

## 🔧 Android-Specific Implementation

### **Device Usage Stats (Android Only)**
```dart
// This is Android magic - iOS can't do this
import 'package:usage_stats/usage_stats.dart';

class AndroidMonitoring {
  Future<List<UsageInfo>> getAppUsage() async {
    // Gets list of all apps child used
    // How long they used each app
    // When they used them
    return UsageStats.queryUsageStats(startDate, endDate);
  }
}
```

### **Background Service (Always Running)**
```dart
// Like a security guard that never sleeps
@pragma('vm:entry-point')
void backgroundService() {
  // This runs even when app is closed
  // Monitors child's phone 24/7
  // Sends alerts to parents
}
```

## 🚨 Auto-Launch Implementation

### **Method 1: Boot Receiver (Starts with phone)**
```xml
<!-- In AndroidManifest.xml -->
<receiver android:name=".BootReceiver">
  <intent-filter android:priority="1000">
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED"/>
  </intent-filter>
</receiver>
```

```dart
// When phone turns on, this runs
class BootReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
  void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
    // Start AlaGuard automatically
    // Child can't stop it
  }
}
```

### **Method 2: App Usage Monitoring**
```dart
// Watches what apps child opens
class AppUsageWatcher {
  void watchAppLaunches() {
    // When child opens any app
    // AlaGuard records it
    // Sends to parent immediately
  }
}
```

## 📊 What Parents See vs What Children See

### **Parent App (Control Center):**
- Dashboard with all children
- Real-time activity monitoring
- Warning alerts
- Time limit controls
- App blocking features

### **Child Experience:**
- **Option A:** Normal phone use (invisible monitoring)
- **Option B:** Restricted launcher (controlled environment)
- **Option C:** Guided mode (educational focus)

## 🛠 Technical Requirements for Full Functionality

### **Android Permissions Needed:**
```xml
<!-- Super important permissions -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.DEVICE_ADMIN"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE"/>
```

### **iOS Limitations:**
- Can't monitor other apps deeply
- Can't run true background services
- Can't be a launcher replacement
- More restricted but still functional
